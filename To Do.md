# To Do
1. Make it so that the project selector is autofilled based on the sections included in the HTML: Javascript makes the labels and such
2. Add project selector to projects
    - It's a little sidebar that expands when hovered over, and it has a bunch of checkboxes, each representing a project display. When an option is chosen, that project is displayed. Otherwise, hidden. First 2 or 3 projects are auto-chosen, rest aren't
3. Add and remove objects from navbar depending on project selector

# Miscellaneous / maybes
- Asd personal page: showcase Power Ranking placements and marathon time
- Add MySQLShell to projects
